          test="'After a few months of working with Lukas, I'm down a total of 28 lbs. Functional strength has increased and I feel great. 
                Since this ain't my first rodeo, I can honestly say that what separates Lukas from other personal trainers is the personal part. 
                I've never had another trainer track progress, isolate trouble areas or create a program that felt so individual to my needs. 
                At 43, I'm literally in the best shape that I've ever been. Thanks!'"

I started training with him about 2 years ago, and havenâ€™t looked back since. He makes programs and sessions that put you to work, but also is sure to incorporate exercises that you enjoy. You always leave feeling good!'"

            test="'Training with Lukas remotely and in person has been one of the best experiences I've ever had with a personal trainer. 
                    I've had multiple trainers in the past and never really got to where I wanted to be. After training with Lukas for the past 6+ months, I've noticed a difference 
                    in my body and overall health goals. I highly recommend anyone interested in any form of training to work with Lukas.'"

                Since this ain't my first rodeo, I can honestly say that what separates Lukas from other personal trainers is the personal part. 
                I've never had another trainer track progress, isolate trouble areas or create a program that felt so individual to my needs. 
                At 43, I'm literally in the best shape that I've ever been. Thanks!'"

I started training with him about 2 years ago, and havenâ€™t looked back since. He makes programs and sessions that put you to work, but also is sure to incorporate exercises that you enjoy. You always leave feeling good!'"

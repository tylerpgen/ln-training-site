    review: `"Training with Lukas remotely and in person has been one of the best experiences I've ever had with a personal trainer. I've had multiple trainers in the past and never really got to where I wanted to be. After training with Lukas for the past 6+ months, I've noticed a difference in my body and overall health goals. I highly recommend anyone interested in any form of training to work with Lukas."`,

    review: `"Lukas is extremely knowledgeable of anatomy and his craft! He knows exactly how to ease you into a program and a routine, to not get you discouraged and to bring you the best results possible.
    I started training with him about 2 years ago, and havenâ€™t looked back since. He makes programs and sessions that put you to work, but also is sure to incorporate exercises that you enjoy. You always leave feeling good!"`,
